# Unity Visualizations

Collection of shaders and visual effects created for Unity 3D. Most of these have been developed as a part of my [World of Zero YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/worldofzerodevelopment).

## Packages

#### Bezier Curves [1](https://youtu.be/tgCFzoG_BJM) [2](https://youtu.be/4zizgh2duqY)

Extend Unity's Line Renderer to enable drawing Bezier Curves with an unlimited number of points

#### Block Terrain

Work in progress building a block based terrain system (similar in style to what Minecraft does).

#### [Contour Map](https://youtu.be/AK8oV4BzrW4)

A quick and easy way to draw cartographic maps with contour lines using a Heightmap.

#### [Fake Volumetric Lighting](https://youtu.be/nX682vFtT6I)

Simple volumetric spotlights that use vertex colors to simulate a volumetric cone of light.

#### [Game of Life](https://youtu.be/ItPTBSeGjdM)

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Unity 3D Compute Shaders

#### [Night Vision Camera Effect](https://youtu.be/mElPESXcakM)

An image effect inspired by the Outlast video game series which uses a combination of the depth map and the scenes albedo to illuminate the world.

#### [Particle Shaders](https://youtu.be/2TBCozxI7-I)

A collection of shaders designed for particle systems.

#### [Pixelating Image Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bTFVaKGIIQ)

An introductory image effect designed to reduce the number of horizontal and vertical pixels to a fixed amount.

#### [Reality - Trace Effect](http://gamejolt.com/games/reality/106584)

Developed for Reality as part of the [Asylum Jam 2015](http://gamejolt.com/tag/asylumjam2015). Creates a "trace" from a given object that reveals the vertex color of the object under it.

#### [Red - TV Grain](http://gamejolt.com/games/red/207577)

Developed for the [Asylum Jam 2016](http://gamejolt.com/tag/asylumjam2016). This was used to render the TV's blur in Red. Adds random noise "grain" to a texture.

#### [Revealing Flashlight](https://youtu.be/b4utgRuIekk)

Shader which is revealed by a spotlight and invisible in all other cases.

#### [Shield Shader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeZcAYJdkv4&list=PLEwYhelKHmihp8GNb-XXWE5VhqikYwluj)

An energy shield shader that reacts to impacts against it.

#### [Squishy Sphere](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEwYhelKHmig3VnNBTurD98bDWR1oCRM-)

Sphere shader that causes them to collapse as they collide with a plane.

#### [Tranquility - Morph3D Realtime Aging](http://gamejolt.com/games/tranquility/126359)

Perhaps not the most efficient way to solve this problem, but an easy way to do it. Allows animating various [Morph3D](https://www.morph3d.com) trait "groups" in order to simulate aging. Developed originally for Tranquility in the [Music Video Jam of 2016](http://gamejolt.com/tag/mvjam16).

#### [Transformation Cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzhxginBhdc)

A shader that can skew and rotate the vertices of a mesh in real time.

#### Unity Terrain - [Grass](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEwYhelKHmigG2uo6zW-LNKtmYUHpC5z4)

Unity terrain is a collection designed around building immersive (and awesome) environments. Still very much a work in progress!

## Other Effects

#### [Twinkle - Gradient Shift Image Effect](https://github.com/WorldOfZero/Twinkle-AGJam/tree/master/Assets/Twinkle/Shaders)

Twinkle was a game developed for the [Audio Game Jam of 2016](http://jams.gamejolt.io/AGJam). This gradient shift was the only visual effect in the entire game and was designed to visualize the position and intensity of sounds. The entire project is open sourced including a full web server for synchronizing worlds between players.
